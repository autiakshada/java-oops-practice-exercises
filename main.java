/*Create an interface named `Shape` consisting of two abstract methods named
`calculateArea()` and `calculatePerimeter()`.

1. Create a class named `Rectangle` which implements the `Shape` interface.
2. Create a class named `Circle` which implements the `Shape` interface.
3. Create an object of the `Rectangle` class and assign it to a reference variable of the `Shape` interface.
4. Create an object of the `Circle` class and assign it to a reference variable of the `Shape` interface.

The overridden methods should calculate and print the following output:

For the `Rectangle` class:
- `calculateArea()` should calculate the area of the rectangle.
- `calculatePerimeter()` should calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.

For the `Circle` class:
- `calculateArea()` should calculate the area of the circle.
- `calculatePerimeter()` should calculate the circumference of the circle.

Implement the classes and interface with appropriate method implementations.
